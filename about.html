		<p>Greetings, I'm Jennifer. I am a UX designer and information architect, comic artist, librarian, goth, Hellboy expert, pop music snob, and bird nerd.</p>

		<p>I have graduate degrees in both Information and Library Science and Art History. I wrote my graduate thesis on Mike Mignola's comic series <cite>Hellboy</cite>. I collect art history books on post-Civil War American and fin-de-si&egrave;cle art, especially John Singer Sargent. I also read comics, gothic novels, various mythology, and the occult. My favorite novel is <cite>Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell</cite>.</p>
		
		<p>I wear all black, almost always. Once a year I go to the beach and wear all color and no black. The only thing that varies in color throughout the year is my hair.</p>
		
		<p>I read reference books backwards. I like taking a record out of its sleeve and putting it on a turntable. I like labeling things. I feel better when there are machines on. I can probably tell you what kind of bird that is.*</p>
		
		<p class="epsilon">(My website has an odd name. It is inspired by a Sigue Sigue Sputnik song that I discovered as a Nine Inch Nails cover. I like collecting things, and I also like NIN. So here we are.)
