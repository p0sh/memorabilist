			Hi. I'm Jennifer L. Anderson, and I'm a <span class="gamma">UX designer and information architect specializing in discovery, wireframing, and prototyping</span>. I've been a digital designer for over 15 years. I love to work with a smallish team of superheroes with whom I can collaborate on some great UI experiences that offer clear access to information and <span class="gamma">also look beautiful</span>.

			<p><span class="gamma">I learned to design in code</span> in 1999. Since then I've been fortunate to have a varied career in user experience design. The following are some examples of my work.</p>
			
			<h3 class="text--center">Wireframes</h3>
			<p>I have wireframed projects using a variety of software (OmniGraffle, Balsamiq, Illustrator) at both high and low fidelity. I like to use the wireframes to have <span class="gamma">an iterative conversation</span> with the project stakeholders and quickly test design hypotheses before going to prototype.</p>

<p>One of Infor's major product suite pages got a refresh in order to reinforce its role as a portal to the Cloud concept and products. In designing this, I considered the need for users to find their particular relevant information quickly within a layout that would balance targeted actions with lively engagement. I promoted the current marketing campaign ("No Two Clouds") as well as our blog, and included an expert video alongside the relevant targeted content. I also showcased customer success stories by industry in order to contextualize their relevance.</p></figcaption>

<p>This was for an exhibition site, whose goal was to showcase NYPL's illustrative treasures in Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. The wireframes I created helped facilitate conversation between the high-level stakeholders on the project, which had previously been a challenge. The wireframes went through several iterations in accordance with the weekly stakeholder check-ins, and we were able to achieve a strong and functional design as a result.</p>
					
<p>This is the design for the landing page of each of the religions; from here the user learns a bit about each representative treasure, and can click to that object's individual page. </p>

<p>One of the challenges for this project was to find a design that visually presented the three religions equally. The solution was to present the objects side by side, with emphasis given to the images, in order to showcase the artifacts as much as possible.</p></figcaption>

<p>The 2015 redesign plan allows readers to use their online profile to keep a record of the titles and the time they spend reading during the season. This home page design prioritizes signing up for an account, while secondarily suggesting books and events to the reader.</p>

<p>This is the first Summer Reading plan to include the mobile context in its design. As of this writing, the new site is not live.</p>

			<h3 class="text--center">Documentation</h3>
			
			
				<p>One of my major projects at NYPL was the conception and creation of <span class="gamma">the Library's first web properties style guide and rapid prototyping system</span> <a href="https://github.com/NYPL/NYPLBase">(see the code  at GitHub)</a>. Still a work in progress, the goals of this project were to produce a package of code to be used by developers that provides NYPL branding and a reference website that documented NYPL design patterns.</p>

					<figcaption><p class="fig--title">The <a href="http://nypl.github.io/NYPLBase/styleguide/">style guide</a> of NYPLBase (currently a work in progress), New York Public Library</p>
					
					<p>After struggling with the institution's lack of design documentation, I decided to build my own. I designed the patterns and styling, tested paper prototypes, and built the first version of the code base over a period of about 6 months. The code of NYPLBase is built on the InuitCSS Sass framework, and provides an easy way to quickly build styled, mobile-ready prototypes.</p></figcaption>

			<h3 class="text--center">Design & Coding</h3>


			
			
			<p>For 8 years at the New York Public Library, I worked on the <span class="gamma">design and layout</span> of <a href="http://www.nypl.org">NYPL.org</a>, as well as other of its core web properties. (Note: most NYPL projects were designed as responsive.)</p>
			
			<div class="figures">
				
				<figure class="fig--portfolio  ">
					<a href="http://www.nypl.org/"><img src="img/portfolio/NYPL-HP.png" alt="screenshot NYPL.org " ></a>
					<figcaption><p class="fig--title"><a href="http://www.nypl.org/">NYPL.org</a>: home page</p><p>This design came out of a prototype that displayed many events and features at once, in an effort to demonstrate the depth and breadth of the Library's offerings. Subsequent user testing of the prototype was very positive, with many users expressing surprise and delight at the variety of the Library's offerings. The final design is tied to a back-end Drupal function that allows each feature to be easily reordered in the view.

					<a href="http://locations.nypl.org/"><img src="img/portfolio/NYPL-Locations-hp.png" alt="screenshot NYPL.org Locations" ></a>
					<figcaption><p class="fig--title"><a href="http://locations.nypl.org/">NYPL.org Locations</a>: find a branch and their various services and offerings</p><p>The Locations redesign project took approximately 13 months, during which time the Locations section was reevaluated using a card sort exercise and given a content audit. Several surveys also went out to staff, to collect information about how they used the Locations section. This data informed new designs, which were tested in prototype using iPads at one of the Library's branches. Further testing was done during a beta trial period, accessible from the main site.</p>

<p>The result was a service-oriented approach to serving branch information to our patrons. Users can now search zip codes and keywords to find their branch, as well as sort by geolocation and research branches only.

					<figcaption><p class="fig--title"><a href="http://www.nypl.org/support">NYPL.org Support</a>: how to contribute to the Library by donating or volunteering</p><p>The Support pages redesign aimed to clarify the variety of ways to contribute to NYPL, and to highlight the impact donations made to the Library as a whole. I worked with the Development Department as a "UX team of one" to plan the content priorities, test iterations of wireframes, and hone the content message. </p>

<p>The redesigned pages were much cleaner, and resulted in an increase in membership of approximately 33%.

					<figcaption><p class="fig--title"><a href="http://www.nypl.org/support/donate">How to donate</a> to the Library</p><p>The Donate page was new content to this section, and the goal was to collect under one heading all the ways to give to the Library. I used icons to offer visual interest and help guide the eye to each item. I also kept the "Donate Now" button prominent, as a major goal of this page was also to get users to the donation form.

Also, A/B testing was done on the "Join or Renew!" button to determine the best language.</p></figcaption>
