		<p>By day I'm a UX designer and information architect specializing in discovery and prototyping. I've been a digital designer for almost 20 years. I enjoy working with a smallish team of superheroes with whom I can build beautiful ways to access information.</p>
		 
		<p>By night I make art, mostly comics.</p>

		I have both an MLS and an MS in Art History. I wrote my <a href="http://cat.pratt.edu/record=b1133269">graduate thesis on <i>Hellboy</i></a>. I collect art history books on post-Civil War American and fin-de-siècle art, especially John Singer Sargent. I also read comics, gothic novels, and occult and mythology. I label everything. I feel better when there are machines on. I can probably tell you what kind of bird that is.
